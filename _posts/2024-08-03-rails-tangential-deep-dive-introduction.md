title: Ruby on Rails Deep Dive Tangent Following
---

I'm on leave at the moment for an extended period, which means I'm itching for tech and
programming! I use Ruby on Rails every day at work, but as is often the way there's things I do
all the time, but don't ever think about and don't necessarily understand.

Usually I don't have time to go down all the rabbit holes and follow all the tangents,
but while I've _sort of_ got time and a mental itching for software stuff I thought it'd be fun
to follow all those tangents and keep a note of where they end up.

As such my intention (**spoiler alert**: I've already started actually and have notes on paper
to write up) is to take a Ruby on Rails app, run the `bin/rails start` command, and go down
any tangents that spring to my mind.

If you're reading this (have you nothing better to be doing?) I'll probably be assuming at least
some level of familiarity with Rails. Nothing is intended as a tutorial. This is for me
to organise my thoughts and document my findings.
