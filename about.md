I've been working as a software engineer in Scotland since 2017.

Nowadays I use Ruby On Rails for my day job, but I worked previously with Java, Python, and Angular.
I like playing with various other things in my spare time, particularly Rust and hardware right now.

I'm a firm believer in using the right tool for the job and not being dogmatic around technologies.

By "background" I'm a physicist and still maintain a keen interest in physics, particularly medical physics.

Any posts I write will almost certainly contain no groundbreaking or original ideas. They're
more likely me drawing together and organising my thoughts and opinions on something or documenting
something I've done.
