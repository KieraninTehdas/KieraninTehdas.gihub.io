Formerly a single random musing. Now hopefully some deep dives on how bits of Ruby On Rails amongst other things works.

I've been a dev since 2017 when I worked at a health tech startup using Spring Boot and
Python mostly, and Angular occassionally. I even got to work on an AngularJS Ionic app!

Back then I worked on message driven microservices and thought that was "the way".
Nowadays I work in fintech with a Ruby on Rails monolith. It's been around the block,
it's not new and shiny, and initially I didn't like it at all,
but nowadays I think Rails is super powerful and there are some
really exciting things happening in the community.
