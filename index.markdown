I've been working as a software engineer at a health tech company in Scotland since 2017.

In my day to day work I mainly use Spring Boot and Python, but also work on Angular apps now and again.
I love learning new things and am keen to diversify, hence most of my spare time projects are focused around Javascript/HTML/CSS and other random things.
I'm a firm believer in using the right tool for the job and not being dogmatic around technologies.

By "background" I'm a physicist and still maintain a keen interest in physics, particularly medical physics.

One day I might even write a blog post about something...
