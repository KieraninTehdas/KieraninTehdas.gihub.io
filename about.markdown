I've been working as a software engineer at a health tech company in Scotland since 2017.

In my day to day work I mainly use Spring Boot and Python, but also work on Angular apps now and again. I love learning new things and am keen to diversify, hence most of my spare time projects 
are focused around Javascript/HTML/CSS.

Joining a startup in its early days and growing along with it has allowed me to work on a wide 
range of varied projects and take the lead on key areas of our platform. It has taught me 
the value of compromise and having something in a userâ€™s hands rather than having the perfect 
solution never completed. I have learned to embrace, though never quite accept chaos and become 
comfortable with fast changing and uncertain requirements. I enjoy and seek out opportunities to 
pick up new skills, work with different people, and push myself beyond what I do every day. 
Perhaps most importantly, I have learned how to make mistakes. 
I believe strongly in using the right tool or language for the job and that tests are not nice-to-haves!

By "background" I'm a physicist and still maintain a keen interest in physics, particularly medical physics.
