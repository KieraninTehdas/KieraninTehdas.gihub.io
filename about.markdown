I've been working as a software developer for a health tech startup since 2017, mostly doing Java and a bit of Python.
Business need has meant I've recently had to diversify into Javascript and front-endy things too. It turns out I actually
quite like doing visual things! One day I might even style this blog a bit...

I love watching talks from conferences, particularly GOTO, so I thought I'd do the odd post of what I've been watching recently
and what I have taken from it.
